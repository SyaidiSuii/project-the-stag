## 🚀 How to Use the System

### For Kitchen Staff (Chefs):

1. **Login** with one of the test accounts:
   ```
   Email: chef.ali@thestag.com
   Password: password
   ```

2. **Auto-redirect** to KDS (Kitchen Display System)
   - You'll see ONLY your station's orders
   - Cannot switch stations (locked to your assigned station)
   - Auto-refreshes every 10 seconds

3. **Managing Orders:**
   - Click "Start Preparing" when you begin cooking
   - Click "Mark Ready" when food is ready
   - Click "Need More Time" if you need +10 minutes
   - Click "Call Manager" if you need help (emergency button)

### For Admin/Manager:

1. **Access Kitchen Dashboard:**
   ```
   URL: https://the_stag.test/admin/kitchen
   ```

2. **View Station Overview:**
   - See all stations at once
   - Monitor load percentages
   - View active orders per station
   - Check alerts and bottlenecks

3. **Access KDS (Kitchen Display):**
   ```
   URL: https://the_stag.test/kds
   ```
   - Can switch between stations
   - "All Stations" view available
   - Full control over all orders

4. **Handle Alerts:**

## 🔄 How Order Distribution Works

### Automatic Assignment (When Order is Created):

1. **Order is placed** by customer
2. **System analyzes** each menu item in the order
3. **Checks station type** for each item (based on `menu_items.station_type`)
4. **Finds optimal station:**
   - Looks for stations of that type
   - Checks current load vs capacity
   - Calculates load score
   - Assigns to least-loaded station
5. **Creates station assignment** in database
6. **Updates kitchen load** for that station
7. **Chef sees order** on their KDS immediately

### Example Order Flow:

**Order #123** contains:
- Nasi Goreng (Hot Kitchen)
- Caesar Salad (Cold Kitchen)
- Iced Lemon Tea (Drinks)

**System automatically:**
1. Assigns Nasi Goreng → Hot Cooking Station (Chef Ali)
2. Assigns Caesar Salad → Cold Prep & Salads (Chef Sarah)
3. Assigns Iced Lemon Tea → Beverages & Drinks (Barista John)

**Each chef sees:**
- Chef Ali: Only the Nasi Goreng
- Chef Sarah: Only the Caesar Salad
- Barista John: Only the Iced Lemon Tea

**Order completes when:**
- ALL three chefs mark their items as ready
- System combines them for service
