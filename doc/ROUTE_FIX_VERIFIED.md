# ✅ Route Fix Verification - Complete

**Date**: 31 Oktober 2025
**Status**: FIXED & VERIFIED

---

## 🐛 Original Error

```
Route [admin.rewards.index] not defined.
```

**Location**: `resources/views/admin/rewards/voucher-templates/form.blade.php:73`

**Root Cause**: Route was defined as `admin.rewards.dashboard` but views expected `admin.rewards.index`

---

## 🔧 Fix Applied

**File**: `routes/web.php` (Line 530)

### Before:
```php
Route::get('/', [RewardsController::class, 'index'])->name('dashboard');
```

### After:
```php
Route::get('/', [RewardsController::class, 'index'])->name('index');
```

**Rationale**:
- 7 view files use `route('admin.rewards.index')`
- Only 1 route definition needed changing
- Route name 'index' is more standard for main dashboard routes

---

## ✅ Verification Results

### Route Registration Check:
```bash
$ php artisan route:list | grep "admin.rewards.index"
GET|HEAD  admin/rewards .................... admin.rewards.index › Admin\RewardsController@index
```

**Status**: ✅ Route properly registered with correct name

---
