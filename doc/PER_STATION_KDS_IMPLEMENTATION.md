## Implementation Date
2025-10-20

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Database Changes**

**Migration**: `2025_10_20_220139_add_assigned_station_to_users_table.php`
- Added `assigned_station_id` column to `users` table
- Foreign key to `kitchen_stations` table
- Nullable (optional station assignment)
- Cascades to SET NULL on station deletion

### 2. **Roles & Permissions**

**New Role**: `kitchen_staff`

**Kitchen Staff Permissions:**
- `kitchen.view.own` - View own station only
- `kitchen.order.update` - Update order status
- `kitchen.help.request` - Request help from manager

**Admin Permissions** (added):
- `kitchen.view.all` - View all stations
- `kitchen.view.own` - View own station
- `kitchen.order.update` - Update order status
- `kitchen.redistribute` - Redistribute orders
- `kitchen.analytics` - View analytics
- `kitchen.config` - Configure settings

**Manager Permissions** (added):
- `kitchen.view.all`
- `kitchen.view.own`
- `kitchen.order.update`
- `kitchen.redistribute`
- `kitchen.analytics`

### 3. **User Model Updates**

**File**: `app/Models/User.php`

**New Field in $fillable:**
```php
'assigned_station_id'
```

**New Relationships:**
```php
public function assignedStation()
{
    return $this->belongsTo(KitchenStation::class, 'assigned_station_id');
}
```

**New Helper Methods:**
```php
public function isKitchenStaff()      // Check if user has kitchen_staff role
public function canViewAllStations()  // Check if admin/manager
```

### 4. **KDS Controller Updates**

**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/OrderController.php`

**Auto-Filter Logic** (lines 44-47):
```php
// Auto-filter by user's assigned station if they are kitchen staff
if (!$stationId && $user->assigned_station_id && $user->isKitchenStaff()) {
    $stationId = $user->assigned_station_id;
}
```

**How It Works:**
1. Check if user has `assigned_station_id`
2. Check if user is kitchen staff
3. If both true â†’ Automatically filter KDS by their station
4. Admins/Managers bypass this (can view all)

### 5. **KDS View Updates**

**File**: `resources/views/admin/kitchen/kds.blade.php` (lines 600-614)

**Visual Changes:**
- Header shows station name when filtered
- "My Station - [Station Name]" subtitle for kitchen staff
- "All Stations" subtitle for admins/managers
- Station name appears in gold color next to logo

**Before (All Users):**
```
ðŸ”¥ The Stag KDS
Kitchen Display System - All Stations
```

**After (Kitchen Staff):**
```
ðŸ”¥ The Stag KDS â†’ Hot Kitchen
My Station - Hot Kitchen
```

## How to Use

### Step 1: Assign Kitchen Staff to Stations

**Option A: Via Database** (Quick test)
```sql
-- Find user ID and station ID
SELECT id, name, email FROM users WHERE email = 'chef@example.com';
SELECT id, name FROM kitchen_stations WHERE is_active = 1;

-- Assign user to station
UPDATE users SET assigned_station_id = 1 WHERE id = 5;
```

**Option B: Via User Management** (Recommended for Phase 2)
- Add station dropdown in user create/edit form
- Coming in Phase 2

### Step 2: Assign Kitchen Staff Role

```sql
-- Get role ID
SELECT id, name FROM roles WHERE name = 'kitchen_staff';

-- Assign role to user
INSERT INTO model_has_roles (role_id, model_type, model_id)
VALUES (3, 'App\\Models\\User', 5);
```

Or via Tinker:
```php
php artisan tinker

$user = User::find(5);
$user->assignRole('kitchen_staff');
$user->assigned_station_id = 1;  // Assign to station ID 1
$user->save();
```

### Step 3: Test the KDS

1. **Login as Kitchen Staff**
   - Navigate to `/admin/kitchen/kds`
   - Should automatically see only their station's orders
   - Header shows "My Station - [Station Name]"

2. **Login as Admin/Manager**
   - Navigate to `/admin/kitchen/kds`
   - Should see all orders by default
   - Can manually filter by station if desired

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Migration runs successfully
- [x] Role seeder creates kitchen_staff role

2. `database/seeders/KitchenStaffRoleSeeder.php`

### Modified:
1. `app/Models/User.php` - Added station relationship and helper methods
2. `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/OrderController.php` - Added auto-filter logic
3. `resources/views/admin/kitchen/kds.blade.php` - Added station name display

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to undo these changes:

```bash
# Rollback migration
php artisan migrate:rollback --step=1

# Remove role (optional)
php artisan tinker
Role::where('name', 'kitchen_staff')->delete();
```

---

## Technical Notes

- **Backward Compatible**: Existing users without assigned stations work normally
- **Optional Feature**: Station assignment is nullable - not required
- **Admin Override**: Admins can always view all stations regardless of assignment
- **Safe Deletion**: If a station is deleted, assigned_station_id automatically sets to NULL
- **No Breaking Changes**: All existing KDS functionality preserved
