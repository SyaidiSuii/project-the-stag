## 🚀 How It Works

### **1. Setup (One-Time)**
```bash
php artisan migrate                              # ✅ Already done
php artisan db:seed --class=KitchenStationsSeeder  # ✅ Already done
```

**Result:**
- 4 stations created: Hot Cooking, Cold Prep, Beverages, Desserts
- 7 categories assigned default stations

### **2. Automatic Workflow**

**Step 1:** Customer places order → Admin confirms
- Status changes to `confirmed`
- 🎯 **System automatically:** Distributes order to optimal stations
- Load balancing algorithm selects best station based on:
  - Current capacity (85% threshold)
  - Queue length
  - Item complexity
  - Average completion time

**Step 2:** Kitchen prepares order
- Dashboard shows real-time load percentages
- Overload alerts trigger at 85% capacity
- Notifications: Audio + Toast + Title flash

**Step 3:** Order completed
- Status changes to `completed`
- 🎯 **System automatically:** Releases all station loads
- Analytics updated

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### **Categories** (`/admin/categories`)
When creating/editing categories, you can set:
- **Default Station Type** - hot_kitchen, cold_kitchen, drinks, desserts
- **Default Load Factor** - 0.3 (fast) to 2.0 (complex)

All menu items in category inherit these settings.

### **Menu Items** (`/admin/menu-items`)
When creating/editing menu items, you can override:
- **Station Type** - Override category default
- **Kitchen Load Factor** - Override complexity

**Note:** Leave empty to inherit from category.

### **Stations** (`/admin/kitchen-loads/stations`)
For each station, configure:
- **Name** - Display name
- **Type** - hot_kitchen, cold_kitchen, drinks, desserts (immutable)
- **Max Capacity** - Concurrent orders (default: 10)
- **Operating Hours** - Start/End time
- **Description** - Optional notes
- **Active Status** - Enable/disable

---

## 📊 Algorithm Details

### **Load Balancing Score**
Lower score = Better station choice

**Formula:**
```
Total Score = Capacity Score + Queue Score + Complexity Score + Time Score

Where:
- Capacity Score: Current load % (0-100 points)
- Queue Score: Pending assignments × 5 (max 50 points)
- Complexity Score: Total load points × 2 (max 30 points)
- Time Score: Avg completion time ÷ 2 (max 20 points)
```

### **Overload Detection**
- Threshold: **85%** capacity
- Triggers: Alert log, visual indicators, notifications
- Actions: Red border animation, toast notification, title flash
